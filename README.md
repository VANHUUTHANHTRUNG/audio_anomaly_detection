## Introduction

The inception of this project is from DCASE challenge 2021, task 2: Anomalous Sound Detection (ASD) [1]. The idea to identify whether the sound emitted from a machine is normal or anomalous. In the chosen challenge, domain shift was introduced with the goal of improvement in newly observed conditions for the anomaly detection model. As a result, our model will be more robust to real-world application with a large variation in operational conditions.
